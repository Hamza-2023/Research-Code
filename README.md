# MVP: predicting pathogenicity of missense variants by deep learning

This repository contains codes to train MVP model and predict missense variants pathogenicity. 


# code and tutorials: 
code/1_prepare_files_for_MVP.ipynb: Generate missense variants features for training and prediction for MVP models.

code/2_train_MVP_models.ipynb: Train MVP models with selected positives and negatives missense variants.

code/3_MVP_prediction.ipynb: Generate MVP raw scores for input variants. 

code/4_get_MVP_prediction_for_all_missense_variants.ipynb: Generate MVP raw scores for all rare missense variants, convert raw score to rank percentile scores.

code/models.py: functions used in MVP model.
